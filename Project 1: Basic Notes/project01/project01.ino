// Transducers: change other types of engergy into electrical energy and vice versa
  // Sensors: covert other forms of energy into electrical energy
  // Actuators: covert electrical energy into other types of energy
 
// Current: amount of electrical charge flowing past a specific point. Measured in A (amps)
// Voltage is the difference in energy between one point in a circuit and another (V)
// Resistance is how much a compnent resists the flow of electrical energy (Ohm symbol)

// Example: height of a cliff is the Voltage, the rocks tumbling down it is the Current, any brush or trees in the way is Resistance
